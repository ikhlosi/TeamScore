# TeamScore

For my "mobile" course: learning React Native.

Small second assignment.

The app lets you add 2 teams, after which the option to add a team disappears. Then you can select a team and increment its score. It has some functionality to test out various aspects of a beginner app in React Native: touches, handling events, hiding keyboard, conditionally showing components, conditionally adding/removing functionality, using state, etc.
